"""
[WIRED] MQTT publishing via paho-mqtt.

No hardware dependency - just needs a broker running. Easiest local setup:

    # Install Mosquitto (a free, lightweight MQTT broker)
    # Windows: https://mosquitto.org/download/
    # Mac:     brew install mosquitto && brew services start mosquitto
    # Linux:   sudo apt install mosquitto && sudo systemctl start mosquitto

    pip install paho-mqtt

Then MQTT_BROKER_HOST/PORT in vision/config.py ("localhost"/1883) will
work out of the box for a broker running on the same machine. If the
broker runs elsewhere (e.g. a separate server the arm machine talks to
over the network), just update those two values.
