"""
[WIRED] Direct MongoDB access for the arm/vision pipeline.

Writes to the same "Collections" database 4DAI's Server/main.py uses
(see vision/config.py: MONGO_URI/MONGO_DB_NAME point at the same
defaults - "mongodb://localhost:27017" / "Collections"), so 4DAI's
Streamlit view_data.py can browse the "objects" category with no changes
on the 4DAI side, as long as both point at the same MongoDB instance.

This is deliberately the ONLY module that talks pymongo directly.
Everything else (session_manager, object_catalog, csv_logger,
excel_export, capture_pipeline, the NLP agent) calls into here rather
than opening its own connection, so there is exactly one place that
knows about collection names / connection details.

COLLECTIONS
-----------
  objects        - one document per capture (the "log"). _id = object_id.
  images         - one document per photo. _id = image_id, object_id = FK.
  sessions       - one document per calendar day. _id = "YYYY-MM-DD".
  object_catalog - one document per distinct *known* object (the
                   "inventory" view). _id = catalog_id. Populated/linked
                   automatically by vision.storage.object_catalog, never
                   written to directly by callers elsewhere.

SETUP
-----
    pip install pymongo

Make sure MongoDB is running (see 4DAI's README - `mongosh` should
connect successfully) before using this module.
