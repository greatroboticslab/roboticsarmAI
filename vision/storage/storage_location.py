"""
[WIRED] Permanent, repo-independent storage location for everything
this app writes to disk — images, CSV/JSON logs, Excel reports.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
---------------------
Before this, every write path (vision.camera.capture's old hardcoded
IMAGES_ROOT = "images/objects", vision.storage.csv_logger/excel_export/
json_logger's directories, vision.storage.package_export's old
hardcoded IMPORTED_IMAGES_ROOT, vision.services.photo_transfer's
save_root default) was a path relative to wherever the process's CWD
happened to be — normally the repo folder. That meant:

  (a) deleting/replacing the repo folder (a fresh `git pull` clone, or
      downloading a new zip to pick up an update) silently orphaned
      every photo/report ever captured — the data was never actually
      IN the repo, just sitting in a folder that happened to share a
      parent with it, and
  (b) the location wasn't configurable — you couldn't point it at an
      external drive or a synced folder without editing source.

This module fixes both: a single configurable ROOT, persisted in a
JSON file OUTSIDE the repo entirely (in the user's home directory), that
every storage-writing module now asks for its actual directory through,
resolved fresh on every call rather than cached at import — so changing
the location mid-run (via the Sync & Storage tab's "Storage Location"
panel) takes effect immediately, no restart needed.
