# TEMPORARY: currently near full extension (close to the IK singularity
# boundary discussed earlier). Fine for early wiring/testing, but should be
# moved to a corner position (lower radius, off-axis) before relying on it
# for repeated/production capture. Swap the values below when ready — every
# consumer of PHOTO_STATION (main.py's yellow dot, the capture pipeline)
# will pick up the change automatically.

# Camera — USB (OpenCV / UVC). Supports any number of cameras, each given
# a name. Device indices are OS-assigned by plug order; confirm with
# `python -m vision.camera.capture` (no .py) once cameras are plugged in.
#
# Add/remove entries here for however many cameras you actually have -
# nothing else in the code needs to change. "station" and "wrist" are
# just the two names the existing pipeline already uses; add more (e.g.
# "overhead", "side") and they immediately become selectable in the live
# feed panel and available to capture_frame().

# Laser — USB serial (pyserial, already in requirements.txt). Most USB

#      or `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux/Mac) before/after plugging it in.
#   2. Check any datasheet/manual for the exact ON/OFF command + baud rate.
#      b"1"/b"0" and b"ON\n"/b"OFF\n" are both common defaults for cheap
#      relay-style modules - try the simplest first.
