"""
[WIRED] USB camera capture via OpenCV.

Works for any standard UVC-class USB webcam (the vast majority of USB
cameras) using nothing but a device index - no vendor SDK needed. If your
camera turns out to need a specialized SDK (e.g. an industrial/machine-
vision camera rather than a plain webcam), swap the cv2.VideoCapture
calls below for that SDK's frame-grab call; everything calling
capture_station_frame()/capture_wrist_frame() elsewhere stays the same.

SETUP
-----
    pip install opencv-python

Then find your camera indices - plug in one camera at a time and run:

    python -m vision.camera.capture

This opens each index 0-4 briefly and reports which ones produce a frame,
so you can confirm STATION_CAMERA_INDEX / WRIST_CAMERA_INDEX in
vision/config.py before relying on them in the real pipeline.

      width/height/fps/format_request - the camera's primary output
                              format. These are meant to be picked as a
                              set from a real detected format (see
                              probe_camera_modes()) — the exact
                              width/height/fps/pixel-format combos the

                              _do_pick_detected_mode()).

                              format_request is what actually
                              distinguishes two formats that share the
                              same resolution/fps (this camera's Y16 vs
                              RGB24 both exist at e.g. 752x480@60).

                              BUGFIX (Y16 was coming out identical to
                              RGB24 — "B just overridden by A"): the
                              previous version only ever toggled
                              CAP_PROP_CONVERT_RGB (raw=True/False) to
                              try to select between formats. That
                              property controls whether a backend does
                              color conversion AFTER capturing — it does
                              NOT select between genuinely different USB
                              Video Class format descriptors the way
                              this camera's Y16-vs-RGB24 actually work,
                              which are negotiated at the USB/driver
                              level. So toggling it did nothing on this
                              camera: A and B ended up requesting the
                              exact same real format regardless of the
                              setting, producing pixel-identical frames
                              under different filenames — which looked
                              like "B is just A again", because it
                              genuinely was. format_request now instead
                              stores either None (driver default), the
                              string "mono" (still tries
                              CAP_PROP_CONVERT_RGB=0 — this DOES work on
                              some ordinary webcams), or an explicit
                              4-character FOURCC string like "Y16 " —
                              set via CAP_PROP_FOURCC, which is the
                              property that actually selects between
                              distinct UVC format descriptors. fps=None
                              means "don't request a specific framerate,
                              take whatever's default".
      extract_lenses        - if True, every capture_frames_multi() call
                              for this camera splits the frame into ONE
                              PHOTO PER COLOR CHANNEL instead of saving
                              it as one image — see _extract_lenses().
                              For a camera whose "RGB24" output isn't
                              real color but three different views (e.g.
                              left/right/computed) packed one per
                              channel, this is how you get each of those
                              views out as its own separate, correctly-
                              viewable grayscale photo instead of one
                              frame that looks like RGB noise. No-op
                              (nothing to extract) for an already single-
                              channel format like Y16/GREY.
      keep_original          - only meaningful when extract_lenses is
                              on. If True, ALSO saves the original,
                              un-split combined frame as an extra photo
                              alongside the extracted per-channel ones —
                              off by default, since the whole point of
                              extraction is usually to get past a
                              combined frame that just looks like noise,
                              but it's there as an option if you want
                              both.
      alternate_lenses        - only meaningful when extract_lenses is
                              on. If True, each successive photo request
                              saves only ONE extracted lens instead of
                              all of them — cycling to the NEXT one each
                              time (view 0 this capture, view 1 the
                              next, back to view 0 after that, and so
                              on) rather than saving every view on every
                              single photo. Useful when you want each
                              capture event to be one lightweight image
                              instead of N, while still eventually
                              covering every view across a sequence of
                              captures. See _next_lens_index below for
                              the per-camera cycling state this uses.
      dual_capture          - if True, every capture_frames_multi() call
                              for this camera rapid-fires a SECOND shot
                              at width_b/height_b/fps_b/format_request_b/
                              extract_lenses_b right after the primary
                              one.
      width_b/height_b/fps_b/format_request_b/extract_lenses_b - the
                              second profile, same meaning as above.
                              Default to the same as primary if not set
                              separately.

    a frame into N vertical spatial slices left-to-right, which is the
    wrong operation for a camera like this — its "RGB24" output isn't
    real per-pixel color at all, it's three DIFFERENT views (e.g. left
    lens, right lens, and a third computed one) each packed whole into
    one of the R/G/B channels of an otherwise-normal-looking color
    frame. Viewed as real color, that looks like a psychedelic red/
    green/yellow mess — because it's not color data being displayed,
    it's three unrelated grayscale images fighting for the same three
    channels. The fix is to split by CHANNEL, not by space: this pulls
    the R plane, G plane, and B plane apart and returns each as its own

    makes it hard to tell cameras apart by index alone once more than one
    or two are plugged in. This shells out to PowerShell to pull the same
    "Cameras" list Device Manager shows, so the Camera tab can display e.g.
    "index 2 - Logitech BRIO" instead of just "2".

    BUGFIX (printers showing up instead of cameras): the previous version
    filtered WMI's PNPClass on 'Camera' OR 'Image'. 'Image' is Windows'
    legacy WIA (Windows Image Acquisition) device class, which covers
    SCANNERS and multi-function PRINTERS with a scan feature too — not
    just cameras — so on a system with a networked/USB MFP printer, its
    name showed up in this list right alongside (or instead of) actual
    cameras. Fixed: uses Get-PnpDevice -Class Camera first — the modern,
    camera-SPECIFIC device class Device Manager's "Cameras" node uses,
    which doesn't include scanners/printers at all — and only falls back
    to the older 'Image' class (still filtering out anything whose name
    looks like a printer/scanner) for older cameras that only ever
    registered under that legacy class.

    IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Windows' PnP device enumeration order and OpenCV's
    backend enumeration order are NOT contractually guaranteed to match -
    in practice they usually line up (both generally follow USB
    enumeration order), but this is a best-effort positional pairing for
    display purposes, not a verified index<->name mapping. Good enough to
    visually distinguish "is index 2 the BRIO or the cheap webcam" at a
    glance; don't treat it as authoritative for anything safety-critical.

    Returns {} (never raises) on non-Windows, if PowerShell isn't
    reachable, or on any enumeration failure - callers must handle a
    missing/empty mapping gracefully and just fall back to showing the
    bare index, same as before this existed.

    released by another program mid-session, the stale handle would keep

    BUGFIX (photo "one behind" what it should be): a cv2.VideoCapture
    handle that's left open between captures (as ours are - see the

    frame queue filling in the background even when nothing calls

    was ALREADY sitting at the front of that queue - i.e. a frame grabbed
    before the thing you actually wanted to photograph happened (the
    object/arm as it looked a moment ago), not a fresh one grabbed right
    now. This is why a capture consistently shows the scene from just

    plus its ACTUAL returned resolution, framerate, and pixel format
    name (see _describe_pixel_format() — a real FOURCC like "MJPG"/
    "YUY2" when the backend reports one properly, otherwise inferred
    from the frame's actual shape/dtype, e.g. "Y16"/"RGB24").

    resolution_filter=(width, height) and/or fps_filter=<int> narrow the
    search to just that resolution and/or framerate instead of the full
    candidate sweep — exposed on the Camera tab as "Detect Formats"
    filter fields. Narrowing the search also unlocks a MUCH deeper pixel
    format search (see below) since the total combo count stays bounded
    either way.

    BUGFIX (Y16 was coming out identical to RGB24): the previous version
    only ever toggled CAP_PROP_CONVERT_RGB to try to distinguish formats
    at the same resolution/fps. That property controls post-capture
    color conversion — it does NOT select between genuinely different
    USB Video Class format descriptors, which is what this camera's
    Y16-vs-RGB24 actually are. Toggling it did nothing on this camera:
    every attempt silently landed on the same real format, so entries
    that were supposed to be different formats came back pixel-
    identical. Fixed: format selection is now tried via explicit
    CAP_PROP_FOURCC requests (the property that actually does select
    between UVC format descriptors) in addition to the CONVERT_RGB=0
    "mono" attempt (kept — it DOES work on some ordinary webcams).
    When the search is unfiltered (testing every resolution/fps), only
    [driver default, "mono"] are tried per resolution/fps pair to keep
    the total sweep bounded (13 resolutions x 11 framerates x 2 = up to
    286 attempts). When resolution and/or fps has been narrowed down via
    the filters, the FULL set of candidate FOURCC codes is also tried at
    each remaining resolution/fps pair, since the search space shrinks
    enough to afford it — this is how you actually confirm/find e.g.
    "Y16 " vs "RGB24" as genuinely distinct results rather than
    duplicates.

    Labeled the same way e-con's own OpenCVCam.exe reference tool lists
    a camera's supported formats ("FormatType: Y16 Width: 752 Height:
    480 Fps: 60") so the list here reads the same way if you've compared
    against that tool.

    Generic candidate list only (common resolutions/framerates/pixel
    formats) — this makes no assumption about what kind of camera is
    plugged in; it reports whatever the hardware actually says it
    supports rather than assuming any particular camera model. Restores
    a normal handle at this camera's configured settings once done.

    Returns a list of dicts, one per WORKING combo — only combos that
    produced a plausible non-blank frame are included, so this is the
    definitive "what does this camera actually support" answer:
      {"width", "height", "fps", "format_request", "fourcc", "label", "actual_shape", "actual_dtype"}

    Shared "what do we actually save for this frame" logic for both the
    primary and alternate profiles in capture_frames_multi() below.
    `profile_label` is "primary" for the A profile or "alternate" for
    the B/dual-capture profile — used directly in the saved suffix so
    filenames say what they actually are instead of a bare letter. If
    extraction is off, just the one frame under `profile_label`. If it's
    on:
      - Every channel _extract_lenses() actually finds is labelled by
        color/plane ("r"/"g"/"b"/"a"/"ch<N>" — see _channel_label), NOT
        a bare index, so a channel that turns out to contain nothing
        useful (e.g. a blank "r" channel) can be identified by name and
        dropped via `channel_keep` below rather than by trial and error.
      - channel_keep: if given (non-empty), only extracted channels
        whose label is IN this list are actually saved as photos —
        anything else extracted this frame is silently skipped. None/
        empty keeps every extracted channel (old behavior).
      - alternate=False (default): every KEPT channel, every capture,
        suffixed "<profile_label>_split_<label>" (e.g. "primary_split_r",
        "primary_split_g").
      - alternate=True: only ONE channel this capture (from the KEPT
        set), cycling to the next one next time — "the next photo is
        just the other secondary view" instead of every view every
        time. Rotation position is tracked per-camera, independent of
        channel_keep, but only ever lands on a currently-kept channel.
      - keep_original=True additionally includes the un-split original
        combined frame as one more entry, suffixed "<profile_label>_original".
      - depth_map=True additionally computes and saves a depth/disparity
        image (see vision.camera.stereo_depth), suffixed
        "<profile_label>_depth". The two channels fed into it are
        chosen by depth_left_channel/depth_right_channel (by label —
        see _pick_depth_source), independent of channel_keep, so a
        channel can feed depth even if it's been dropped from the saved
        photos; if neither is set, this falls back to the first two
        extracted channels (old behavior).

        MONO CAMERAS: if the frame only has ONE channel at all (a plain
        mono/grayscale camera — e.g. a single non-stereo camera on the
        arm's wrist — there is no second view to pair it with), the
        SAME single frame is used for both sides so a depth map can
        still be produced on request rather than refusing outright.
        This has no real stereo baseline whatsoever, so the result is
        expected to be heavily inaccurate/near-meaningless — it's
        offered anyway (clearly flagged, both here in the console and
        wherever the UI surfaces this toggle) because a rough result on
        request beats a hard refusal for someone who just wants to see
        something. Any real depth failure (bad/misaligned pair, etc.)
        never blocks saving the actual photos.

    BUGFIX (dual capture returning solid-white photos and crashing): the
    first version of this switched profiles with a bare cap.set() on the
    SAME still-open handle, then read immediately. Several UVC cameras —
    stereo/industrial ones especially — don't actually renegotiate their
    stream that fast (or at all without a full restart); reading right
    after a live property change caught the sensor mid-reconfiguration,
    producing blank/white frames and in some cases wedging the driver
    badly enough to crash. Fixed by fully CLOSING the handle, reopening
    fresh at the B profile, discarding a few warm-up frames to let the
    new stream settle, THEN reading — the same "give the hardware a
    moment" approach probe_camera_modes() uses — before closing that and
    reopening once more back at the A/primary profile for whatever uses
    this camera next (live feed, the next capture).

    Returns a list of (suffix, frame) pairs. Normal case: one pair,
    suffix "primary". If the primary profile's extract_lenses is on and
    the frame has multiple channels: one pair per KEPT channel
    ("primary_split_r", "primary_split_g", ...— named by channel, see
    _channel_label/channel_keep) normally, or just ONE pair for
    whichever channel is next in rotation if alternate_lenses is on,
    plus a "primary_original" pair too if keep_original is on. Dual
    capture adds the equivalent "alternate"/"alternate_split_r"..
    "alternate_original" pairs for the second (actually-different-
    camera-output) profile. Callers save each pair under a different
    view_index so they never collide on disk (see main.py's
    capture_movement_snapshot()/run_manual_snapshot()), and should also
    pass the suffix itself through as the saved photo's view_label (see
