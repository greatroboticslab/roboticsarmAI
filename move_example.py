    # This API subscribes to the idea that the USER should handle exceptions and not force their hand by raising exceptions, but it comes with the price of simple code being verbose and needing an error handling function.
    # In the future, there will be in-built handler functions on DobotError types to panic or raise exceptions easily, if wanted explicitly.
