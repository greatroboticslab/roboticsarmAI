# Robotic Arm Controller

A Python application that controls a robotic arm by inputting **Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z)**.  
Future version: will allow control through **individual joint angles**, enabling movement by controller and later by AI.

---

## Features
- Move the robotic arm by specifying X, Y, Z coordinates  
- Easy visualization of coordinates given:
  - Added a graph showing coordinate location along the xy-plane
  - Added a list of coordinates that follow a FIFO protocol

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotic-arm-controller.git
   cd robotic-arm-controller
