    Best-effort resolution for an image path pulled out of Mongo.

    Paths written from this session on are already absolute (see
    vision.camera.capture.save_image / vision.services.photo_transfer.
    save_photo_bundle_files), so this is normally a no-op. It exists for
    situations that otherwise show up as a bare "No such file or
    directory" with no indication of why:

      1. The absolute path was baked in at capture time by a DIFFERENT
         copy of this app than the one running right now — e.g. images
         captured from a previous unzip/clone of this repo, or from
         before vision.storage.storage_location existed, or the storage
         location was reconfigured since. The path's images/... suffix
         is usually still intact even though its prefix no longer
         exists; re-anchor that suffix under the CURRENT storage
         location (vision.storage.storage_location.get_storage_root())
         and check there before giving up. This is the common case in
         practice — it's what makes photos from an earlier session (or
         an earlier delivered zip) keep working after re-extracting a
         fresh copy of the app.
      2. Genuinely old data with a RELATIVE path stored (pre-dates the
         absolute-path fix entirely) — retry it relative to this repo's
         own root as a last resort.
      3. The images/ folder was moved to a different machine entirely
         (e.g. after Export Package + Import Package elsewhere) —
         nothing can fully recover from that automatically, but the
         caller gets back the best-guess path so the resulting error at
         least shows a path that makes it obvious what to check.

    those touched these globals at all. Left unsynced, the NEXT manual
    action that reuses them (e.g. "Manual Z", clicking a new point, or
    sending the point queue - all of which used to hardcode J4 back to 0
    regardless of the arm's actual wrist angle) would start from a stale

    were never actually commanded ("making up moves"). This mirrors the

# AUTO-CAPTURE ON ARM MOVEMENT
# =====================================================================
# Two independent toggles (checkboxes live on the Camera tab, built
# further down):
#   - auto_capture_on_move_var:  every PROGRAMMATIC move (rotation
#     sequences, the pickup+photograph pipeline, remote MQTT move
#     commands, the manual "Move Joints" button — i.e. every direct
#     robot.movement.joint_to_joint_move() call site, all routed through
#     _dispatch_joint_move() below) fires one capture right as the move
#     is issued and a second one 1 second later.
#   - auto_capture_on_jog_var: continuous keyboard/button jogging (see
#     handle_jog_press/handle_jog_release) fires one capture on first
#     press, one on release, and one every 1 second for as long as the
#     key/button stays held.
# Both are deliberately declared as tk.BooleanVar()s further down (after
# `root = tk.Tk()` exists — a Tk Variable needs a live root) but are
# referenced here by name only inside function bodies, which Python
# resolves at CALL time, not at def time, so the forward reference is
# safe: by the time a move/jog actually happens the GUI (and these
# vars) already exist.
#
# Captures taken here are deliberately NOT run through
# run_manual_snapshot()/record_capture() (Mongo write + server upload
# per image): jogging can fire this every second for as long as a key
# is held, and a network round trip per frame would fall further and
# further behind. Instead this is a lightweight, local-disk-only save
# (capture_frame + save_image, same primitives everything else in this
# file uses) — good enough to have a visual record of "what did the
# scene/arm look like around this move", filterable/deletable later by
# its "robot_arm_moving_..."/"manual_jog_moving_..." sample-id prefix,
# without adding load to Mongo or the network on every single move.

#                       controls, the point queue, and sending instructions
#                       to the arm. No control-mode/Middleman UI here — see
#                       "Virtual".
#   Tab 2 "Virtual"   — Control Mode (Demo / Physical Manual /
#                       Middleman (Robot Side) / Remote Control) and every
#                       Middleman-specific panel (remote queue, discovery/
#                       connect dropdown, remote capture, remote laser
#                       toggles). Split out of the Arm tab so "driving this
#                       machine directly" and "being/using a remote
#                       controller" aren't competing for the same screen.
#   Tab 3 "Camera"    — the working "Capture Photo" flow (save + log to
#                       MongoDB + upload) at the top, live webcam view, and
#                       camera selection. No laser controls here — see
#                       "Laser".
#   Tab 4 "Laser"     — the ESP32 laser controller: connect/disconnect,
#                       PWM configure/arm/fire, and the per-channel relay
#                       toggles. Split out of "Camera" so it reads as its
#                       own subsystem rather than a camera accessory.
#   Tab 5 "Server"    — the server URL (test-local by default), connection
#                       testing, and the server-triggered continuous-sweep
#                       automation.
#   Tab 6 "Database"  — a browser for what's stored in the local MongoDB
#                       (kept separate from "Server" so either can grow
#                       independently later).

    Every `tab_xxx` variable is reassigned to this inner frame (not the

    The inner frame's width AND height each track whichever is LARGER —
    the visible canvas dimension, or the content's own natural size —

    BUGFIX (root cause of rotation-capture moves "returning a -1"):
    every rotation loop (run_automatic_capture_sequence,
    run_data_collection_rotation_local, and the server-dependent pickup
    pipeline) computes each step as `base_j4 + i * degrees_per_step` with
    no bounds check at all, unlike the manual "Move Joints" row (which
    validates against J4_SAFE_LIMITS and shows a clear "Out of Range"
    dialog *before* ever contacting the robot - see manual_joint_move()).
    A rotation sweep of more than a few steps, or one that starts from a
    J4 already partway toward a limit, very quickly commands a J4 target
    outside +/-358 degrees. The robot firmware rejects that JointMovJ
    with its own error code, but that code isn't one of the ones
    dobot_util/types.py's DobotError enum knows about, so
    _parse_response()'s fallback (see dobot_util/util.py) reports it as
    the generic DobotError.FAIL_TO_GET - which prints/displays as a bare
    "-1" with no indication the real problem was simply an out-of-range
    wrist angle.

    Fix: since a wrist rotation of exactly 360 degrees returns the joint
    to the same physical orientation, any target outside the safe range
    has an equivalent, in-range target reached by adding/subtracting
    whole 360-degree turns - so wrap it back into range here instead of

    values (only updated live via the 50Hz feedback loop into
    robot_data) could still drift apart — e.g. if the manual entries were
    stale, or a previous jog left the arm somewhere the pipeline's
    Ikinematics call didn't account for. Taking the photo at the CURRENT

# =====================================================================
# DATA COLLECTION TAB — "pick up an object, rotate it via J4, take N
# photos, log ONE object with all N images." Works in three
# control_mode_var states:
#   - "physical_manual" / "demo": this machine drives the arm + camera
#     directly (mirrors the proven run_automatic_capture_sequence loop
#     a few hundred lines up, but logs through capture_pipeline.
#     record_capture() once at the end instead of the old 4DAI REST
#     submission flow that function still uses).
#   - "middleman_other" (Remote Control): this machine has no local arm/
#     camera. It drives J4 moves and requests captures over MQTT via
#     other_side_controller, coordinating the async photo bundles with
#     vision.services.rotation_coordinator so all N views land under
#     ONE object, then calls record_capture() itself once done — this
#     machine's Mongo/CSV/Excel is authoritative either way, matching
#     "the controller still has all of this work, and Excel is used
#     for data collection there."
#   - "middleman_physical" (Robot Side): this machine's arm/camera are
#     being driven remotely — the Start button here is refused with an
#     explanatory message, since starting a second, locally-initiated
#     sequence at the same time as a remote-driven one would fight over

#   - Auto-capture on arm movement: every programmatic move (rotation
#     sequences, pickup+photograph pipeline, remote MQTT moves, the
#     manual "Move Joints" button) fires a photo when the move starts
#     and another 1s later, saved under a "robot_arm_moving_..." folder.
#     See trigger_arm_move_autocapture()/_dispatch_joint_move() above.
#   - Auto-capture while jogging: keyboard/button jogging fires a photo
#     on press, one every 1s while held, and one on release, saved under
#     a "manual_jog_moving_..." folder. See _start_jog_autocapture()/
#     _stop_jog_autocapture() above.
#   - Fix laggy/delayed photos: flushes a couple of buffered frames
#     before every capture so a photo can't come out showing the scene
#     from a moment before it was actually taken (see
#     vision/camera/capture.py's _capture_from_index). OFF by default -
#     it costs a little time per capture - turn on only if photos are
#     actually coming out visibly behind reality.
# Both auto-capture vars default ON per how this is meant to be used;
# the lag-fix defaults OFF since it's a fix for an intermittent issue,
# not something everyone needs paying the cost of on every capture.

# CAMERA ASSIGNMENT — reassign which physical USB device index a named

# camera, without editing vision/config.py or restarting the app.
# Reassigning an EXISTING name takes effect immediately (both the live
# feed panel above and every capture path re-read the assignment on their
# next frame grab). Adding a brand-new name is picked up immediately by
# anything that calls list_configured_cameras() fresh each time it runs
# (the "Capture Photo — All Cameras" button, automatic capture sequences),
# but the live-feed panel grid above is built once at startup, so a new
# camera's preview panel needs an app restart to appear.

# and laser_control/relay_controller.py for the full serial protocol). This
# is a separate physical board/serial connection from the arm itself, so it
# gets its own connect/disconnect lifecycle here.
#
# Mirrors the firmware's own safety model rather than adding a competing one:
#   - Configure (pin/freq/max-duty) before anything else is allowed.
#   - Explicit ARM step required before any nonzero duty is accepted —
#     configuring or connecting never arms it by itself.
#   - A background heartbeat thread pings the board every second while
#     connected so the firmware's 2-second host-silence watchdog doesn't
#     auto-disarm mid-use just because the user hasn't touched a control
#     lately. (The watchdog itself only ever fires while armed AND duty>0,
#     per firmware — this heartbeat just keeps the host from going quiet.)
#   - Disconnecting (or closing the app) always disarms first.
